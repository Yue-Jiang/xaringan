name: Feature request
about: Want a new feature?
---

Please note that **xaringan** is a wrapper of the JS library remark.js: https://github.com/gnab/remark It is likely that the new feature request should be filed to the remark.js repo. If you are sure it belongs to **xaringan**, please file it here.

If you can implement the feature by yourself, that will be great and we will be happy to review your pull request when we have time. If the feature is relatively complicated, please file an issue to talk about what you intend to do before actually implementing it, since we don't want to waste your time on an implementation that we are unlikely to accept.
